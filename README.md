## My Process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I Learnt
- Render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component using React Portals.
- Manage state logic using useReducer. 
- Pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level by using React Context
- Prevent reloading of an app when submitting a form using event.preventDefault()


### Continued Development 
- Fetching Available Meals from an external source / backend
- Submitting orders to a backend
- Add a screen to show confirmed order
- Add loader to app
